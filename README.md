# Connecting_workbooks
**The problem**
Many small businessess distribute their products to multiple shops. Many of them track their sales performance using indivdual excel workbooks for each shop. The problem is that many of them would like to view their sales performance across all shops wholistically for an accurate view of their performance.
**The solution**
The db_bot.py program extracts data from different excel workbooks and inputs it into a single sqlite database. This makes it easier for users to view data from multiple excel workbooks wholistically in one file. By using simple sql select queries the user can extract relevent data from the database. The user can then export the query to excel and create compelling dashboards that enable them to conveniently track key performance indicators across multiple shops. This enables them to make better informed decisions quickly which results in increased effeciency.
