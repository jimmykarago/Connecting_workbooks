# Connecting_workbooks
The program extracts data from different excel workbooks and inputs it into a single sqlite database. This makes it easier for users to view data from multiple excel workbooks more wholistically. By using simple sql queries the user can easily join  data from  multiple workbooks. The user can then export the query to excel and create compelling dashboards that enable them to track key performance indicators conveniently.
