# Connecting_workbooks
The db_bot.py program extracts data from different excel workbooks and inputs it into a single sqlite database. This makes it easier for users to view data from multiple excel workbooks wholistically in one file. By using simple sql queries the user can easily join  data from  multiple workbooks. The user can then export the query to excel and create compelling dashboards that enable them to conveniently track key performance indicators.
