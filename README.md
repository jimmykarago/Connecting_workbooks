# Connecting_workbooks
**The problem**
Many small businesses distribute their products to multiple shops. Many of them track their sales performance using individual excel workbooks for each shop. However, many of them would like to view their sales performance across all shops holistically for a more accurate view of their performance.
**The solution**
The db_bot.py program extracts data from different excel workbooks and inputs it into a single SQLite database. This makes it easier for users to view data from multiple excel workbooks in a more cohesive way. By using simple SQL select queries the user can extract relevant data from the database. The user can then export the query to excel and create compelling dashboards that enable them to conveniently track key performance indicators across multiple shops in one workbook. Which enables them to make better-informed decisions quickly that results in increased operational efficiency.
